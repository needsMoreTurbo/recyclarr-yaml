# recyclarr-yaml
Collection of YAML files for recyclarr based on https://trash-guides.info/

## Installation
1) Install recyclarr using instructions at from https://recyclarr.dev/wiki/
2) Configure a script to set environment variables for the URLs and API Keys referenced in the YAML files

## Usage
1) Run the customformats/all*.yml files first to update all custom qualities
2) Run the quality profiles for sonarr or radarr yamls as required (you need to create a placeholder for these first)

## Note
This is an early 'work in progress', use at your own risk. Please check the configurations careful and let me know if you spot any errors, I am happy to add more quality profiles to the main files that would be of broad interest.
